# recursive file stat benchmarking utility

A utility that will perform recursive stat() on all files at and below a
given starting directory.

Useful to measure a system's IO performance for e.g. file backup purposes.
A file backup software which uses file stat information for determining
whether a file has changed or not, is limited by this performance of a system.

## Compilation
